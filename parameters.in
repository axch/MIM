! dt is time step
! slip is 
! nTimeSteps: number of timesteps before stopping
! dumpFreq: frequency of snapshot output
! avFreq: frequency of averaged output
! hmin: minimum layer thickness allowed by model (for stability)
! maxits: maximum iterations for the successive over relaxation algorithm. Should be at least max(nx,ny), and probably nx*ny
! eps: convergence tolerance for SOR solver
! freesurfFac: 1. = linear implicit free surface, 0. = rigid lid. So far all tests using freesurfFac = 1. have failed 
! g is the gravity at interfaces (including surface). must have as many entries as there are layers
! input files are where to look for the various inputs
