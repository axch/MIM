Examples
************************

In the following sections we present some simplified examples and use Aronnax to reproduce a number of published results.

Canonical examples
===================

These simulations use simple domains and and inputs to show how Aronnax can easily be used for idealised modelling studies.


Gaussian bump on a :math:`\beta`-plane

Twin gyre on a :math:`\beta`-plane

Reproducing published results
===============================

These examples show how Aronnax can be used to reproduce results from the literature.


Davis et al. (2014)
---------------------
Reduced gravity configuration of the Arctic


Manucharyan and Spall (2016)
-----------------------------
n-layer configuration looking at eddies in the Arctic. (This was run as an MITgcm experiment, but could be done in an isopycnal model)


Johnson and Marshall (2002)
----------------------------
Reduced gravity analysis of the adjustment of the MOC to changes in deep water formation rates.
