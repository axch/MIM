Examples
************************

In the following sections we present some simplified examples and use Aronnax to reproduce a number of published results to show how Aronnax can be easily configured for a range of idealised modelling studies.

Canonical examples
===================

These simulations use simple domains and and inputs. They show some of the features available in Aronnax


Gaussian bump on a :math:`\beta`-plane
----------------------------------------

This example is initialised with a Gaussian bump in the layer thickness field. The momentum forcing is set to zero.

Reproducing published results
===============================

These examples show how Aronnax can be used to reproduce results from the literature.


Davis et al. (2014)
---------------------
Reduced gravity idealised configuration of the Arctic used to explore adjustment timescale of the Beaufort Gyre.


Manucharyan and Spall (2016)
-----------------------------
n-layer configuration looking at eddies in the Arctic. (The original experiment was run using a z-level model, but it could also be done in an isopycnal model)


Johnson and Marshall (2002)
----------------------------
Reduced gravity analysis of the adjustment of the MOC to changes in deep water formation rates.
